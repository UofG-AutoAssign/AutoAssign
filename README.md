# AutoAssign - Project Summary
Auto-Assign is a React-Django-based website to automatically allocate graduates into teams for a 2-year graduate programme. The types of users that would use the website are Graduates, Managers, and HR.

## Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Badges

On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Project status

If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.

## Steps to generate a skeleton project with `React, TypeScript, Tailwind`

### Prerequisites
- Code editor of your choice (VSCode/Webstorm)
- Node.js
- NPM (Node Package Manager)
    > Installing Node.js + NPM: https://youtu.be/JcwHHpim-CY

### Generating a `React + TypeScript` skeleton project 
1. `npm install vite@latest`
1. `npm create vite@latest` then enter your project name
2. Navigate down to React -> TypeScript
3. `cd {your_project_name}`
4. `code .` (to open up VSCode in that directory)
5. `npm install`
6. `npm run dev` (to check if it works)


### Installing `Tailwind`
1. Install `PostCSS Language Support` extension on VSCode
1. `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`
2. `npx tailwindcss init -p`
3. Your `tailwind.config.js` should look like this:
``` 
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
4. Put üëá in all .css files, since we're writing Tailwind CSS
```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
5. If you're playing around with the skeleton and Tailwind doesn't seem to work ‚Äî make sure to wipe all generated CSS from `App.css` and `Index.css`

### Recommended Extensions for VSCode 
- `HTML CSS Support`
- `ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets`
- `JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly`
- `Tailwind CSS IntelliSense`
- `Path Intellisense`
- `Live Share`
- `Live Server`

### Frontend Deployment Notes
- Login to/Signup for a Netlify account
- `ntl` and connect to your desired Netlify hosting repo
- `npm run build`
- `ntl deploy`
- `ntl deploy --prod`
- Make a new file under /public called `_redirects` with `/* /index.html 200` inside it

# Contributing

State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.
For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.
You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
