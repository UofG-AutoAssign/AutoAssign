# AutoAssign - Project Summary
Auto-Assign is a React-Django-based website to automatically allocate graduates into teams for a 2-year graduate programme. It uses an algorithm that best recommends graduates to their new teams during rotations. The types of users that would use the website are Graduates, Managers, and HR.

When the button is clicked it would automatically assign all graduates to teams (where you can view them by clicking on each team in the Manage Teams Page.
	- This page also shows a table of unassigned graduates and managers before and after pressing AutoAssign.
-	How the AutoAssign Algorithm works
    - The algorithm implements an efficient mechanism for assigning graduates to teams. First, all teams are prioritized according to a preset ratio. Then, according to each team's skill requirements and ratio, the qualified graduates are screened and sorted by match score. The matching score is calculated from the graduate form, including skill, experience, and interest level. Finally, the cosine similarity is used to calculate the matching score, and the weighted sum method is used to calculate the total matching score. 
	- During the automatic assignment process, if a team does not have the corresponding configuration settings, it will not be considered for assignment. At the same time, graduates without skills will also get 0 points and will not participate in the distribution. If there are teams that are not set up, the front end will get a corresponding simultaneity. Graduates who did not participate in the assignment at the end are also shown.
	- The system will retrieve a list of all teams and sort them by proficiency/interest priority. Then, call the get_graduates_by_skill function for each team to find all eligible graduates. All unassigned graduates will then be filtered out and sorted by match score. 
	- Next, the system will iteratively assign graduates until the team is full or all unassigned graduates have been assigned. During this process, to ensure that second-year graduates are not assigned to the departments they were in for first-year. If there are unassigned graduates, they will be randomly assigned to the team with the fewest members. Throughout the process, cosine similarity calculates matching scores; transactions ensure data consistency, and priority and random allocation strategies ensure the fairness and randomness of allocation results.

# Contributing

State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.
For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.
You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
